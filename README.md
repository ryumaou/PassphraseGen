# PassphraseGen
a quick, Powershell passphrase generator

It's pretty simple and basically just what it says: a passphrase generator coded on Powershell.  
The word file, and the basics of the approach, are from this article at the EFF: [Deep Dive: EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases)  But, I encourage you to make your own based on your own personal interests and favorite trivia or fandom.  

To run, just have both files in the same directory, open a PowerShell prompt, and run .\PassphraseGen.ps1
<br>It'll return a single, randomish enough, semi-secure passphrase for you to use.  Seriously, this should be enough for most systems and easier to remember than a totally random jumble of letters and numbers.  It should meet most criteria for minimum passwords, bue feel free to fork this and modify it as you need or desire.
